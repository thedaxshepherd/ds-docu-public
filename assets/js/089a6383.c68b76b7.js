This esentially indicates where the measure \\"lives\\" in the model and is needed for the full definition of the measure. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo I am going to use the Sales table for the home of the measure. This does not impact how the measure works. I could have just as well chosen the Product table and the result would be the same. But if this were Power BI or Analysis Services where you place the measures is more about organization and making the user experience more intuitive.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere I have added the Sales table to the name of the measure.\\r\\n\\r\\n```dax\\r\\nDEFINE MEASURE \'Sales\'[UnitPrice] = SUM(\'Sales\'[Unit Price])\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nMore info on defining a measure can be found here: https://dax.guide/st/measure/\\r\\n\\r\\n## Test\\r\\nBut running the full version of the code still generates an error:\\r\\nQuery (1, 1) The expression specified in the query is not a valid table expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nEspecially when you are learning to use DAX Studio you may run into this error a lot. What it is telling us is that the code we are running is not returning a table expression. We know that when we query using DAX we usually either return a scalar or a table value. If you are not sure what functions return which you can use a site like https://dax.guide/ and it will show the input as well as the return type. Calculate returns a scalar whereas CalculateTable returns a Table. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne trick to turn this Scalar into a table is to use the ROW function. It takes the name of the new column and the expression for the column and returns a table with one or more columns:\\r\\n\\r\\n```dax\\r\\nDEFINE MEASURE \'Sales\'[UnitPrice] = SUM(\'Sales\'[Unit Price])\\r\\nEVALUATE\\r\\nROW(\\"Unit Price\\", CALCULATE([UnitPrice]))\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Solution\\r\\n\\r\\nThis runs successfully\\r\\n\\r\\n{{< figure src=\\"images/DAX_Studio_Result.png\\" width=\\"150\\" alt=\\"Result\\" title=\\"Result\\" >}}\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the ROW function we can give the column a name. We can also repeat this for as many columns as we need.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother option is we can use the table constructor syntax to create a table.\\r\\n\\r\\n```dax\\r\\n{\\r\\n  (CALCULATE([UnitPrice]))\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this does not allow us to name the column. But we can add multiple rows to each column if we want. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese two issues are ones that I encountered a lot when starting to use DAX Studio. Mostly due to the time period between when I would be using DAX Studio."},{"id":"first-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/ds-docu-public/first-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2022-09-26-first-blog-post.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-26-first-blog-post.md","title":"First Blog Post","description":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

If something never launched in the first place I am not sure it can be relaunched. I initially had a WordPress blog on SiteGround. It never made it out of test. I learned a lot about deploying WordPress and the different plugins. It did come in handy when my work started using WordPress for the company site. One of the things I immediately noticed is our site did not have a Favicon.\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\nMoving the blog to GitHub pages was motivated by a couple of factors. The first, it is hard to justify paying for hosting when nothing is being posted to the public. When the renewal came due, it was time to try a different option.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second reason is that by hosting it on GitHub it would encourage me to learn git. \\r\\n\\r\\nI chose Hugo as the static site generator for a couple reasons. It uses one executable for the program without a bunch of dependencies. It uses Go as the template language and I was hoping for one that used a C like language. \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently I am using the DPSG theme for Hugo. I had minimo while developing the site and then Mainroad. DPSG is a fork of Mainroad. I tend to fixate more on the theme instead of the content. I am trying to stick with a theme until I create enough content. I am using Hugo modules for the theme. This makes it easy to update when a new version of the theme comes out. \\r\\n\\r\\nI am using [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/) for the syntax highlighting. Chroma which Hugo uses does not support languages such as DAX or M (Power Query). With PrismJS you can select what languages and options you want to support and then add the references to the config file for the JS and CSS files.\\r\\n\\r\\nI chose to setup my deployment using 3 repositories. I use one for the source code that has the visibility set to private. I deploy using a Bash script.  The repository for the Public folder is using a git submodule and is set to public visibility. Lastly, I have public repository for the comments. \\r\\n\\r\\nI am using <a href = \\"https://utteranc.es/\\">utterances</a> for the blog comments. It uses GitHub issues to store the blog comments. I still have the option to turn off blog comments on a per post basis using the variable in the front matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo edit the markdown I use  <a href = \\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\\">Visual Studio Code</a>. It allows me to preview the code as I write. I use <a href = \\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/\\">Windows Terminal</a> which allows me to have multiple tabs open with Git Bash, PowerShell, and Command Prompt. Windows Terminal is amazing and keeps getting better.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfile picture and various art on the site is by <a href = \\"https://www.how-to-draw-funny-cartoons.com/\\">Martin B\xe9rub\xe9</a>. I have zero artistic ability and really like his animated drawings. When I first setup the blog on WordPress I used the drawing of the sheep as a placeholder for my profile picture - watermark and all. When it came time to pick the actual profile picture I had become attached to the picture. I went ahead and purchased it from Martin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a place where I can discuss my journey with learning new topics on things that interest me. The main focus will be around the Microsoft BI Stack. Topics such as the DAX language, DAX Studio, Tabular Editor, Analysis Services and Power BI. I also plan to discuss tools that help facilitate that journey such as Windows Terminal and Visual Studio Code."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/ds-docu-public/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Docusaurus blogging features are powered by the blog plugin.","date":"2021-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 26, 2021","tags":[{"label":"facebook","permalink":"/ds-docu-public/tags/facebook"},{"label":"hello","permalink":"/ds-docu-public/tags/hello"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/ds-docu-public/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":0.41,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Romans","title":"Shepherd of the DAX","url":"https://github.com/thedaxshepherd","imageURL":"https://github.com/thedaxshepherd.png","key":"jromans"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome","authors":["jromans"],"tags":["facebook","hello","docusaurus"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Using Hugo and GitHub Pages for my blog","permalink":"/ds-docu-public/website-hugo-blog-git"},"nextItem":{"title":"Long Blog Post","permalink":"/ds-docu-public/long-blog-post"}},"content":"[Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog).\\n\\nSimply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.\\n\\nRegular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\nThe blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:\\n\\n- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`\\n- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`\\n\\nA blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpeg)\\n\\nThe blog supports tags as well!\\n\\n**And if you don\'t want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config."},{"id":"long-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/ds-docu-public/long-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2019-05-29-long-blog-post.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-29-long-blog-post.md","title":"Long Blog Post","description":"This is the summary of a very long blog post,","date":"2019-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 29, 2019","tags":[{"label":"hello","permalink":"/ds-docu-public/tags/hello"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/ds-docu-public/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":2.135,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Romans","title":"Shepherd of the DAX","url":"https://github.com/thedaxshepherd","imageURL":"https://github.com/thedaxshepherd.png","key":"jromans"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"long-blog-post","title":"Long Blog Post","authors":"jromans","tags":["hello","docusaurus"],"comments":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/ds-docu-public/welcome"}},"content":"This is the summary of a very long blog post,\\n\\nUse a `\x3c!--` `truncate` `--\x3e` comment to limit blog post size in the list view.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
